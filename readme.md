# base53

base53 is a bootstrap template for laravel.
Its based on [inspinia-responsive-admin-theme](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S)

Purchase the theme if you want to use.

I wish I could (_or someone would_) purchase the extended license and make it Opensource


## Installation

This is like any other git project. All you have to is:

1. Click clone repository

2. In the terminal type git clone

## Contributing

This is bootstrap. If you can rewrite the whole css and retain the behaviour to make it open source it would be great.
Just fork the project rewrite it and commit the changes.

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within base53, please send an e-mail to Taylor Otwell at taylor@laravel.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

Remember, this is based on laravel 5.3 >
## License

This project uses two licences:

Laravel's **MIT** and **Wrapbootstrap _Licence_**

## Disclaimer

base53 is the base template I use when building my laravel based application.

Do note that you should only clone this repo if you have purchased the license like i have in order to use in your projects.
